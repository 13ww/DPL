About the paper DLP (2023) code base
the code is coming ........





we propose a dual prototype learning (DPL) based on second-order prototype (SOP) and first-order self-supporting prototype with constraint mechanism (SSFPC) to improve the FSS performance
our contributions are:
(1)We proposed a dual prototype learning for few shot semantic segmentation, terms as DPL. The DPL simultaneously utilizes the first- and second-order prototype of image. 
(2)The first-order prototype generation process based on the self-support mechanism is further optimized by constraining the Euclidean distance between the supporting prototype and the query prototype vectors for the same class of goals. To enhance the robustness and discriminative of prototype, the innovative second-order prototype based on covariance matrix of feature map is proposed.
(3)The proposed DPL model is a lightweight architecture, whose learnable parameters are only 0.5M. And yet, the experiment results are also satisfactory and comparable to the state-of-the-art.
